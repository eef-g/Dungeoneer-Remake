## About

This is an official remake of my [Dungeoneering](https://github.com/eef-g/Dungeoneer) repository! The project is being done to practice the two main technologies that I plan on using for my Senior project:

  The Dungeoneer remake will be made as closely to the original as possible, but with the bonus of <b>no longer requiring the .NET Framework</b> and instead run in a native desktop application.
